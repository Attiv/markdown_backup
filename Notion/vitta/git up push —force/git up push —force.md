You can set branch tips to any particular commit. So if you're trying to reset a branch to a particular commit, with your desired branch currently active, select the commit you want to reset to and hit ‚å•T. Then your branch will be reset to that commit and you can simply push like normal and GitUp will prompt you to force the push because you've diverged from remote.
